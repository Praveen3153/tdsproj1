# GitHub User and Repository Scraper

- This project scrapes GitHub user data from London who have over 500 followers, collecting their profile and repository information.  
- After analyzing the data, it was surprising to find that many users listed their companies as open source organizations, indicating a strong community presence.  
- Developers should consider contributing to projects from these users to enhance visibility and foster collaboration within the tech community.

## How Data Was Scraped

The data was scraped using the GitHub API, which allows for retrieving user profiles and repositories based on specific search criteria. The script searches for users in London with more than 500 followers, gathers their profile details, and fetches their public repositories. Results are saved into two CSV files: `users.csv` and `repositories.csv`.

## Interesting Findings

One of the most interesting findings was that a significant number of users indicated they were hireable, showcasing a potentially strong pool of talent in the London tech community actively seeking opportunities.

## Recommendations for Developers

Based on the analysis, developers should explore contributions to projects owned by these users, as many are engaged with open-source initiatives. Collaborating on these projects could enhance their skills and network within the GitHub community.
